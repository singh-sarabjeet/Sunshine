Sunshine
========

Sunshine is a weather app that fetches data from the OpenWeatherMap API and displays them in a listView.

It uses MySQLite database to store the fetched data and also uses Content Providers and Loaders to fetch back the data from the database if it is already available.

The app follows standard material design guidlines which makes it aesthetic and pleasant for the user. It has different views for phones and tablets to make the most out of the different screen sizes and orientations.
